# Multimedia Encryption & Decryption (Python + Flask)

## 📌 Overview
This project is a **Flask-based web application** that allows users to **encrypt and decrypt multimedia files** including:
- 🖼️ Images  
- 🎵 Audio  
- 🎥 Video  

The goal of this project is to provide a **secure and user-friendly platform** for multimedia data protection using cryptographic techniques.

---

## 🚀 Features
- 🔐 **Encrypt** images, audio, and video files with strong algorithms.  
- 🔓 **Decrypt** encrypted files back to their original format.  
- 🌐 Simple **Flask web interface** for file upload and download.  
- ⚡ Fast and efficient processing.  
- 📂 Support for multiple file formats.  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, Bootstrap  
- **Backend:** Python (Flask Framework)  
- **Encryption:** Python cryptography libraries (e.g., `cryptography`, `pycryptodome`)  
- **Others:** OpenCV / PyDub (if used for multimedia handling)
